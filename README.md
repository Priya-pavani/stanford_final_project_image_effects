             !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT POINT WHILE SVAING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

             TO SAVE THE ALTERED IMAGE WHICH YOU LIKE YOU CAN CLICK ON THE SAVE OPTION BUT HERE WHILE SAVING GIVE EXTENSIION AS   ".jpg"
              It doesn,t take any default extensions you have to so you have to explicitly give .jpg and if you don't give it doesn't show 
              error but it gives you an error that first select the file.
